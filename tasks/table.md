# Table Component Optimization Tasks

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. **Implement Virtual Scrolling for Large Datasets** ❌ REMOVED
- **Priority**: High  
- **Description**: Add virtual scrolling to handle tables with thousands of rows efficiently
- **Benefits**: Significantly improves performance with large datasets, reduces DOM nodes
- **Status**: **REMOVED** - Not needed anymore

### 2. **Optimize ResizeObserver Implementation** ✅
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Description**: Use a single ResizeObserver for all table instances, improve debouncing strategy
- **Benefits**: Reduces memory usage, better performance with multiple tables
- **Status**: **COMPLETED**
- **Implementation**: Created global singleton ResizeObserver with smart debouncing, unique callback IDs, and proper cleanup. Each table instance now uses a shared observer instead of creating its own, reducing memory footprint and improving performance when multiple tables are present.

### 3. **Memoize Heavy Computations** ✅
- **Priority**: Medium  
- **Description**: Add computed caching for expensive operations like column filtering and cell class calculations
- **Benefits**: Reduces unnecessary re-computations on re-renders
- **Status**: **COMPLETED**
- **Implementation**: Added memoization for cell class calculations with cache keys based on column properties and sticky header state. Implemented caching for DOM element queries and page data building. Added proper cache cleanup on component unmount to prevent memory leaks. Cell class computation now uses Map-based caching that significantly reduces repeated class name calculations during table renders.

## State Management with Pinia

### 4. **Create Pinia Store for Table State** ✅
- **Priority**: High
- **Description**: Replace localStorage-based state management with Pinia store
- **Benefits**: Better reactivity, SSR compatibility, centralized state, easier debugging
- **Status**: **COMPLETED**
- **Implementation**: Created comprehensive Pinia store (`stores/table.ts`) with TypeScript support, replacing the localStorage-based system in `components.ts`. The store provides reactive state management, automatic localStorage persistence, computed getters for columns and filtered columns, and proper cleanup functions. Updated Vue app setup to include Pinia. All existing functionality is preserved while gaining better reactivity and centralized state management.

### 5. **Implement Table Store Actions** ✅
- **Priority**: High
- **Description**: Move table operations (filters, sorting, pagination) to Pinia actions
- **Benefits**: Better separation of concerns, testability, reusable logic
- **Status**: **COMPLETED**
- **Implementation**: Extended the Pinia store to include comprehensive table operations including filters, search, pagination, and request handling. Created `useTableOperations` composable that provides a clean interface to store actions. Moved all filtering logic, search functionality, pagination, and loading states to the centralized store. Updated Table.vue component to use the new store-based operations, eliminating direct dependencies on filterable.ts and request.ts utilities. The table now has centralized, reactive state management for all operations.

### 6. **Add Store Persistence Plugin** ✅
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Description**: Use Pinia persistence plugin for localStorage functionality
- **Benefits**: Cleaner code, automatic serialization, better error handling
- **Status**: **COMPLETED**
- **Implementation**: Installed and configured `pinia-plugin-persistedstate` with custom persistence settings. Replaced manual localStorage handling with automatic plugin-based persistence. The store now automatically persists the `tables` state to localStorage with proper serialization/deserialization. Simplified store code by removing manual `loadFromLocalStorage`, `saveToLocalStorage`, and cleanup functions. The plugin handles all persistence operations transparently with better error handling and more reliable storage management.

### 6.1. **Fix Column Visibility Toggle** ✅
- **Priority**: High (Bug Fix)
- **Description**: Fixed column visibility toggle not working due to reactivity issues in toggleColumn function
- **Benefits**: Column show/hide functionality works properly, better user experience
- **Status**: **COMPLETED**
- **Implementation**: Fixed reactivity issue in `toggleable.ts` where the `toggleColumn` function was mutating the reactive array directly instead of creating a new one. Changed the implementation to use `map()` and object spread (`{ ...column }`) to create new column objects, ensuring Vue's reactivity system properly detects changes and updates the template. This resolves the issue where hidden columns were still showing in the table despite being toggled off.

## Code Structure & Architecture

### 7. **Refactor Composables Structure**
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Description**: Split large composables into smaller, focused ones with better separation of concerns
- **Benefits**: Improved maintainability, better testability, cleaner code organization
- **Status**: Pending

### 8. **Improve TypeScript Types**
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Description**: Add generic types for table data, improve type safety across components
- **Benefits**: Better developer experience, fewer runtime errors, improved IntelliSense
- **Status**: Pending

### 9. **Extract Business Logic from Components**
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Description**: Move complex logic from Table.vue to separate utility functions or stores
- **Benefits**: Cleaner components, better testability, reusable logic
- **Status**: Pending

## Component Optimization

### 10. **Implement Component Lazy Loading**
- **Priority**: Low
- **Description**: Lazy load column components and filters that aren't immediately visible
- **Benefits**: Faster initial load times, reduced bundle size
- **Status**: Pending

### 11. **Optimize Event Handlers**
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Description**: Use passive event listeners where appropriate, debounce scroll events
- **Benefits**: Better scroll performance, reduced CPU usage
- **Status**: Pending

### 12. **Add Component Caching Strategy**
- **Priority**: Low
- **Description**: Implement smart caching for column components based on data changes
- **Benefits**: Faster re-renders, better user experience
- **Status**: Pending

## Configuration & Extensibility

### 13. **Create Table Configuration System**
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Description**: Implement a comprehensive configuration system for table behavior and appearance
- **Benefits**: Better customization, easier maintenance, consistent behavior
- **Status**: Pending

### 14. **Add Plugin Architecture**
- **Priority**: Low
- **Description**: Create a plugin system for extending table functionality
- **Benefits**: Better extensibility, modular features, easier customization
- **Status**: Pending

### 15. **Improve Column Definition API**
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Description**: Simplify and enhance the column definition API for better developer experience
- **Benefits**: Easier to use, more intuitive, better documentation
- **Status**: Pending

## Developer Experience

### 16. **Add Comprehensive Documentation**
- **Priority**: Low
- **Description**: Create detailed documentation with examples for all table features
- **Benefits**: Better developer onboarding, easier maintenance, fewer support requests
- **Status**: Pending

### 17. **Implement Debug Mode**
- **Priority**: Low
- **Description**: Add debug mode with performance metrics and state visualization
- **Benefits**: Easier debugging, performance monitoring, better development experience
- **Status**: Pending

### 18. **Add Unit Tests**
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Description**: Write comprehensive unit tests for composables and utilities
- **Benefits**: Better reliability, easier refactoring, fewer bugs
- **Status**: Pending

## Accessibility & UX

### 19. **Improve Keyboard Navigation**
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Description**: Add comprehensive keyboard navigation support

- **Status**: Pending

### 20. **Add ARIA Labels and Screen Reader Support**
- **Priority**: Medium  
- **Description**: Implement proper ARIA labels and screen reader compatibility
